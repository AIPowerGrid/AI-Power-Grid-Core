AI POWER GRID WHITE PAPER
Abstract
AI Power Grid (AIPG) stands at the intersection of blockchain and artificial
intelligence, aiming to make open source AI technology more accessible and
more rewarding for the community. Beginning as a Ravencoin fork, AIPG
initially adopts a Proof of Work (PoW) model to attract GPU miners and then
later transitions to a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) framework, which will allow
these miners to evolve into node operators that will host and manage local AI
workloads.
AI Power Grid aims to provide real-world AI services, such as local LLM
inference and Stable Diffusion image generation, at absoulutely no cost for
community use.  There will also be a paid version that provides users with a
higher tier secured and trusted node along with API access for integrations. 
AIPG is designed to fuel innovation in open-source AI, offering a platform for
enthusiasts to experiment, build, and contribute, thereby democratizing AI
technology and helping pioneer the next era of open source AI
advancements.
Background
AI Power Grid (AIPG) originated from a grassroots movement with a clear
vision: to democratize access to artificial intelligence (AI) and galvanize open
source AI initiatives. We firmly believe in the democratization of AI, ensuring
its vast potential is not restricted to a select few but made accessible to
everyone. AIPG was developed as a fork of the Raven coin, chosen for its PoW
model and ASIC resistance. This decision was made primarily to recruit GPU
miners, and help them transition to the Proof of Useful Work model. During
this phase, development will continue towards nodes and hosting AI
workloads. AIPG envisions expanding its capacity to accommodate diverse AI
workloads in the future and even communication between AI workloads, such
as using image generation tools from an LLM, or creating a Mixture of
Experts system that is capable of complex tasks. The journey of AIPG is a
testament to a dedicated team of developers who are driven by a mission to
page the way for a balanced and sustainable AI ecosystem.
The AI Power Grid Protocol
The AI Power Grid protocol is an innovative system designed to democratize
open source AI. AIPG is built on the principles of fairness, transparency, and
decentralization, with an initial foundation on the ASIC-resistant KawPoW
algorithm during the PoW period. This choice ensures a fair launch and
encourages widespread participation from GPU miners, laying the
groundwork for a future where AI is accessible to all. A significant evolution in
the protocol is the transition to the Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) system. In
this setup, miners' computational resources are devoted to tangible tasks,
predominantly hosting local Large Language Models (LLM) and other
predmonint AI workloads like Stable Diffusion XL. With expansion to other AI
workloads as the network matures. Integral to the PoUW system is the role of
"validator" nodes. These specialized nodes employ a consensus algorithm to
authenticate the accuracy and integrity of LLM inference and other tasks
conducted by nodes. Utilizing cryptographic verification and crossreferencing, the validators mitigate the risk of data manipulation and ensure
honest reporting of computational contributions. To strengthen the
trustworthiness and commitment of these validators, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
mechanism is in place. Validator nodes are required to hold a minimum of
10,000 AIPG coins, ensuring their vested interest in the network's success and
integrity.
The AI Power Grid Economic Model 
AI Power Grid (AIPG) introduces a sustainable and balanced economic model.
Initially, the protocol capitalizes on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism,
granting miners a block reward of 5000 AIPG coins for every block. With a
block time set at 1 minutes, it ensures the efficient and timely processing of
transactions. As AIPG evolves, transitioning to the Proof-of-Useful-Work
(PoUW) system and the associated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms, there
will be a phased reduction in block rewards to encourage early adoption and
active participation. This gradual decline will continue until the total coin
supply nears its 1 billion coin cap. To champion the ongoing development,
innovation, and maintenance of the network, a 5% reward from every mined
block will be reserved for the operations wallet. These funds are pivotal in
driving the continuous growth and evolution of the AI Power Grid ecosystem.
AIPG's economic model is structured to ensure fairness and inclusivity. It
emphasizes rewarding early adopters while laying the foundation for
sustainable growth.
Transition to Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)
AIPG's planned progression from the conventional Proof of Work (PoW) to our
innovative Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) represents a reimagining of
computational value. In the PoUW model, the focus isn't just on expanding
the blockchain, but on endorsing and incentivizing truly productive
computational endeavors. With this transition, node operators within the
AIPG network will take on the role of hosting individual local Large Language
Models (LLM) and other local AI workloads. By doing so, AIPG not only
democratizes access to these powerful AI tools but also actively offers
rewards for hosting and running inference tasks on these models. As the
AIPG ecosystem evolves, our vision encompasses the potential to support a
broader range of AI workloads beyond just LLMs and AI Art. For miners, this
shift to PoUW might necessitate some adjustments to their existing setups,
ensuring they're equipped to optimally host and run LLMs and other potential
AI workloads. This alignment with PoUW is essential to ensure nodes can
handle high PCIe bandwidth AI tasks, reinforcing the network's growth,
security, and overarching mission. By intertwining the domains of blockchain
and AI, AIPG endeavors to stimulate a more inclusive and expansive
movement in AI and machine learning. We're not just nurturing a network;
we're curating a community poised to drive the next wave of AI
advancements.
Future Plans and Roadmap
The trajectory of AI Power Grid (AIPG) is both a testament to our passion for
AI and a roadmap that seeks to catalyze an AI renaissance. 
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of our envisioned milestones: 
Establishment of the PoUW Model: The foundation of our roadmap revolves
around the transition from PoW to PoUW, emphasizing local LLM hosting.
This shift aims to bridge blockchain with tangible, real-world AI applications,
rewarding node operators for hosting and inferencing on LLMs and other
workloads. Validator Nodes Integration: With the integration of validator
nodes, we seek to ensure the authenticity of LLM inference or Stable Diffusion
image generation. These nodes, backed by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism
requiring a 10,000 AIPG and they will use consensus algorithms to validate
and verify AI tasks, ensuring the integrity of the system and discouraging
false reporting. 
Broadening AI Workload Support: As AIPG matures, we anticipate diversifying
beyond LLMs, allowing nodes to host and be rewarded for a broader
spectrum of AI workloads. This expansion is a nod to our commitment to a
dynamic and multifaceted AI ecosystem. Engaging Collaborations: Building
on our potential collaborations, we aim to foster relationships with opensource AI communities, research institutions, hardware providers, and AIdriven industries. These partnerships can enhance the AIPG network's
capabilities, ensuring it remains at the forefront of AI and blockchain
convergence. 
Empowering the Community: Central to our vision is the democratization of
AI. By facilitating access to LLMs and other AI tools, we aspire to empower
individuals, researchers, and developers, making AI a universally accessible
resource rather than a restricted commodity. 
Nurturing Innovation: While our roadmap provides a structured path, we
remain agile and receptive to novel AI advancements. AIPG is committed to
integrating cutting-edge technologies, ensuring our community always has
access to the best in AI. Community Engagement: Recognizing that our
strength lies in our community, we'll be hosting workshops, webinars, and
forums, fostering a space for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and
collective growth. AIPG's roadmap is more than a series of milestones. It's a
call to action, an invitation to be part of a transformative journey in AI. As we
chart this course, we invite every AI enthusiast, developer, and visionary to
join us. Together, we'll usher in an era where local AI flourishes, democratized
and accessible to all.
