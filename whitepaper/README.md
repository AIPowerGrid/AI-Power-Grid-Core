# AI POWER GRID WHITE PAPER

## Abstract

AI Power Grid (AIPG) stands at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, aiming to make open source AI technology more accessible and more rewarding for the community. Beginning as a Ravencoin fork, AIPG initially adopts a Proof of Work (PoW) model to attract GPU miners and then later transitions to a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) framework, which will allow these miners to evolve into node operators that will host and manage local AI workloads.

AI Power Grid aims to provide real-world AI services, such as local LLM inference and Stable Diffusion image generation, at absolutely no cost for community use. There will also be a paid version that provides users with a higher tier secured and trusted node along with API access for integrations. AIPG is designed to fuel innovation in open-source AI, offering a platform for enthusiasts to experiment, build, and contribute, thereby democratizing AI technology and helping pioneer the next era of open source AI advancements.

## Background

AI Power Grid (AIPG) originated from a grassroots movement with a clear vision: to democratize access to artificial intelligence (AI) and galvanize open source AI initiatives. We firmly believe in the democratization of AI, ensuring its vast potential is not restricted to a select few but made accessible to everyone. AIPG was developed as a fork of the Ravencoin, chosen for its PoW model and ASIC resistance. This decision was made primarily to recruit GPU miners, and help them transition to the Proof of Useful Work model. During this phase, development will continue towards nodes and hosting AI workloads. AIPG envisions expanding its capacity to accommodate diverse AI workloads in the future and even communication between AI workloads, such as using image generation tools from an LLM, or creating a Mixture of Experts system that is capable of complex tasks. The journey of AIPG is a testament to a dedicated team of developers who are driven by a mission to pave the way for a balanced and sustainable AI ecosystem.

## The AI Power Grid Protocol

The AI Power Grid protocol is an innovative system designed to democratize open source AI. AIPG is built on the principles of fairness, transparency, and decentralization, with an initial foundation on the ASIC-resistant KawPoW algorithm during the PoW period. This choice ensures a fair launch and encourages widespread participation from GPU miners, laying the groundwork for a future where AI is accessible to all. A significant evolution in the protocol is the transition to the Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) system. In this setup, miners' computational resources are devoted to tangible tasks, predominantly hosting local Large Language Models (LLM) and other p
